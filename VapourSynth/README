        [LibavSMASHSource]
            LibavSMASHSource(string source, int track = 0, int threads = 0, int seek_mode = 0, int seek_threshold = 10,
                             int variable = 0, string format = "", int dr = 0)
                * This function uses libavcodec as video decoder and L-SMASH as demuxer.
            [Arguments]
                + source
                    The path of the source file.
                + track (default : 0)
                    The track number to open in the source file.
                    The value 0 means trying to get the first detected video stream.
                + threads (default : 0)
                    The number of threads to decode a stream by libavcodec.
                    The value 0 means the number of threads is determined automatically and then the maximum value will be up to 16.
                + seek_mode (default : 0)
                    How to process when any error occurs during decoding a video frame.
                        - 0 : Normal
                            This mode retries sequential decoding from the next closest RAP up to 3 cycles when any decoding error occurs.
                            If all 3 trial failed, retry sequential decoding from the last RAP by ignoring trivial errors.
                            Still error occurs, then return the last returned frame.
                        - 1 : Unsafe
                            This mode retries sequential decoding from the next closest RAP up to 3 cycles when any fatal decoding error occurs.
                            If all 3 trial failed, then return the last returned frame.
                        - 2 : Aggressive
                            This mode returns the last returned frame when any fatal decoding error occurs.
                + seek_threshold (default : 10)
                    The threshold to decide whether a decoding starts from the closest RAP to get the requested video frame or doesn't.
                        * RAP is an abbreviation of random accessible point.
                    Let's say
                      - the threshold is T,
                    and
                      - you request to seek the M-th frame called f(M) from the N-th frame called f(N).
                    If M > N and M - N <= T, then
                        the decoder tries to get f(N) by decoding frames from f(M) sequentially.
                    If M < N or M - N > T, then
                        check the closest RAP at the first.
                        After the check, if the closest RAP is identical with the last RAP, do the same as the case M > N and M - N <= T.
                        Otherwise, the decoder tries to get f(N) by decoding frames from the frame which is the closest RAP sequentially.
                + variable (default : 0)
                    Treat format, width and height of the video stream as variable if set to 1.
                + format (default : "")
                    Force specified output pixel format if 'format' is specified and 'variable' is set to 0.
                    The following formats are available currently.
                        "YUV420P8"
                        "YUV422P8"
                        "YUV444P8"
                        "YUV410P8"
                        "YUV411P8"
                        "YUV440P8"
                        "YUV420P9"
                        "YUV422P9"
                        "YUV444P9"
                        "YUV420P10"
                        "YUV422P10"
                        "YUV444P10"
                        "YUV420P16"
                        "YUV422P16"
                        "YUV444P16"
                        "RGB24"
                        "RGB48"
                + dr (default : 0)
                    Try direct rendering from the video decoder if 'dr' is set to 1 and 'format' is unspecfied.
                    The output resolution will be aligned to be mod16-width and mod32-height by assuming two vertical 16x16 macroblock.
                    For H.264 streams, in addition, 2 lines could be added because of the optimized chroma MC.
        [LWLibavSource]
            LWLibavSource(string source, int stream_index = -1, int threads = 0, int cache = 1,
                          int seek_mode = 0, int seek_threshold = 10, int dr = 0,
                          int repeat = 0, int dominance = 1)
                * This function uses libavcodec as video decoder and as demuxer.
            [Arguments]
                + source
                    The path of the source file.
                + stream_index (default : -1)
                    The stream index to open in the source file.
                    The value -1 means trying to get the video stream which has the largest resolution.
                + threads (default : 0)
                    Same as 'threads' of LibavSMASHSource().
                + cache (default : 1)
                    Create the index file (.lwi) to the same directory as the source file if set to 1.
                    The index file avoids parsing all frames in the source file at the next or later access.
                    Parsing all frames is very important for frame accurate seek.
                + seek_mode (default : 0)
                    Same as 'seek_mode' of LibavSMASHSource().
                + seek_threshold (default : 10)
                    Same as 'seek_threshold' of LibavSMASHSource().
                + variable (default : 0)
                    Same as 'variable' of LibavSMASHSource().
                + format (default : "")
                    Same as 'format' of LibavSMASHSource().
                + dr (default : 0)
                    Same as 'dr' of LibavSMASHSource().
                + repeat (default : 0)
                    Reconstruct frames by the flags specified in video stream and then treat all frames as interlaced if set to 1 and usable.
                    If set to 0, video frames consisting of two separated field coded pictures are displayed twice consecutively.
                + dominance : (default : 1)
                    Which field, top or bottom, is displayed first.
                        - 0 : reserved
                        - 1 : TFF i.e. Top -> Bottom
                        - 2 : BFF i.e. Bottom -> Top
                    This option is enabled only if 'repeat' is set to 0.
